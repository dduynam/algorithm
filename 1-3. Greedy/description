Greedy:
	• Build up a solution piece by piece, always choosing the next piece that offers the most obvious and immediate benefit >>> So the problems where choosing locally optimal also leads to global solution are the best fit for Greedy.
Conclusion: For Knapsack problem, local optimal strategy is to choose the item that has maximum value vs weight ratio. This is also the globally optimal solution.

In simple way, takes the best immediate, or local, solution while finding an answer.
Optimal solution in locally.

Specialization: 
	• Dijkstra
	• Kruskal
	• Prim-Jarnik
Prim-Jarnik and Kruskal: find the globally optimal solution --> minimum spanning tree
